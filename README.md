# 🥔🍃 Potato-Leaf-Disease-Prediction
🔹 About the Project
---

- This project can detect diseases in potato leaves using images.
- The system uses deep learning (CNN model) to check if a potato leaf is healthy or diseased.
- It is made for farmers, researchers, and students to quickly identify potato leaf problems.
---

🔹 Dataset
- The dataset has images of potato leaves.
- It is divided into two folders:
- Training set → used to train the model
- Testing set → used to test the model
---

🔹 Model Used
- Model: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- Reason: CNN is best for image data
- Accuracy: ~98% (very high, no overfitting or underfitting)
---

🔹 Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS
- Backend: Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Framework: Flask (connects frontend with backend)
---

🔹 How It Works
- User uploads an image of a potato leaf.
- The image goes to Flask backend.
- CNN model checks the leaf.
- The result page shows whether the leaf is healthy or diseased.
---

🔹 How to Run the Project
- Open the project folder.
- Run the Flask app (press Ctrl+F5).
- A web interface will open.
- Upload a potato leaf image.
- Get the result on the screen.
---

🔹 Folder Rules (Important)
- ✔ All HTML files must be in the templates folder.
- ✔ All images and CSS files must be in the static folder.
---

🔹 Why this Project is Useful?
- Helps in early detection of potato leaf diseases.
- Easy to use for farmers and non-technical users.
- Very high accuracy (98%).
- Saves time and effort in checking crops.
